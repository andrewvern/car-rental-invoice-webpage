This is an aspx webpage designed with Visual Basic alongsize SQL. It functions as an invoice system that stores and retrieves car data.


## **View 1:**
The first view functions to record car rental information. The user will begin by selecting the car brand which filters specific models into the car model dropdownlist. For example, if Subaru is selected, all car models associated with Subaru will be listed. After a car brand and model is selected, the list will filter again to show the cars available for that model. The car models are numbered to track availability and usage information. When a specific car is selected, the starting mileage and color are automatically filled in to correspond to the data in SQL. When selecting Customer Name and the VIP checkbox, the fields are also automatically filled in to correspond to the data in SQL. There are various check-boxes to record if a car needs maintenance. 

## **View 2:**
The second view  functions for ordering more car units. When a new car is purchased, the user can input the car information, like color, brand, and model, to be stored. When the information is inputted the car automatically is assigned an ID. Allows for the retrieval of information based on the unique ID in View 1. 

## **View 3:**
The third view functions for adding more car model options. When the company expands their models options for any brand this view allows for their model information to be stored for later retrieval. 

## **View 4:**
The fourth view functions for creating a new customer and reviewing past customer information. Users will be able to enter new customer information to be stored for later retrieval and are automatically assigned a CustomerID. This customer information is used in View 1 when recording car rental information and retrieving rental information. Past customer information and rental history can be viewed after selecting the Customer ID.
